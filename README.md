This is a simple web page for translating.
- Try it if you're a beginer and want to structure your page.
- I told you that's just a simple so it doesn't have any function.
- Last word: to run it, download and open VScode, copy two files and paste them on your VScode.
  Or you can choose the top-right button <Code> to download Zip file and open it in you VScode.
